## 1. Scenario
A crime has taken place, and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on 15th January, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department‚Äôs database.

## 2. Database Design
Here is the schema Diagram or ERD from the original source
