## 1. Scenario
A crime has taken place, and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on 15th January, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

## 2. Database Design
Here is the schema Diagram or ERD from the original source

Here are the tables and potential information within them:

|No|Table Name|Data Related|
|---|:---:|:---|
|1|**crime_scene_report**|Initial leads information to the specific crime.|
|2|**interview**|Interview result documentation with related person of crimes|
|3|**person**|General profile data|
|4|**drivers_license**|Profile data related person and their car|
|5|**income**|Profile data related to annual income|
|6|**get_fit_now_member**|Membership of *Get Fit Now* Gym|
|7|**get_fit_now_check_in**|Activity log check-in and check-out of *Get Fit Now* Gym members|
|8|**facebook_event_checkin**|Activity log about any event attended by specific person|

## 3. Step-by-step
### 3.1. Crime Scene Report
```sql
SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE city = "SQL City"
	AND type = "murder"
	AND date = "20180115"   # 15 Jan 2018
```

### 3.2. Witness’s Profile
#### Witness #1
```sql
select *
from person
where address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr"
and address_number = (select max(address_number)
from person
where address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr")
```

#### Witness #2
```sql
select *
from person
where address_street_name = "Franklin Ave"
	and lower(name) like "%annabel%"
```

Here are some important information so far:
- From witness #1
    -	The killer has “Get Fit Now Gym” bag with membership number “48z”
    -	It is suspected a gold member only bag
    -	The killer got into car with plate number “H42W”

- From witness #2:
    -	The killer from the same gym of the witness
    -	The murder happened when the witness was working last week on 9th January 2018



### 3.3. Interview Result
```sql
select *
from interview
where person_id in (99826, 14887, 16371)
```


### 3.4. Identify The Killer Profile based on Interview Leads
```sql
select person.id as person_id,
	name, license_id, address_number, address_street_name,
	ssn, age, height, eye_color, hair_color,
	gender, plate_number, car_make, car_model
from person 
join drivers_license on person.license_id = drivers_license.id
where plate_number like "%H42W%"
```

### 3.5. Check for Gym Membership Data
```sql
select *
from get_fit_now_member
where person_id in (51739, 67318, 78193)
and lower(id) like “%48z%”
```

Check-in and check-out activities of gym members
```sql
select *
from get_fit_now_check_in
where membership_id = "48Z55"
```

### 3.6. Track the activities using Social Media
```sql
select *
from facebook_event_checkin
where person_id = 67318
```

Additional insight about annual income the suspect
```sql
select *
from income
where ssn = "871539279"
```

Hmm…. All the information so far leads to Jeremy Bowers as the killer.

Not sure… but all evidence point to him.

Then.. let’s submit that conclusion and see the result.

```sql
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
SELECT value FROM solution;
```


### 3.7. Interview Record with the Suspect
```sql
select *
from interview
where person_id = 67318
```

### 3.8. The Mastermind of the Crime
```sql
select person.name,
	address_number,
address_street_name,
person.ssn,
income.annual_income,
	drivers_license.*,
	event_name,
	_fb.date as event_date
from person 
join drivers_license on person.license_id = drivers_license.id
join facebook_event_checkin as _fb on person.id = _fb.person_id 
left join income on person.ssn  = income.ssn
where car_make = "Tesla" 
	and car_model = "Model S"
	and hair_color = "red"
	and gender = "female"
```

Finally, we have all evidence to corner the perpretrators.

Let's reveal the truth and arrest them!

```sql
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');
SELECT value FROM solution;
```
